    GoSnap by Krzysztof Donat
    
    GoSnap is a program that brings to AmigaOS a window snapping feature 
    known from modern operating systems, allowing windows to snap to the 
    edges of the screen.

    GoSnap creates 8 active zones on the Workbench screen: 4 screen 
    corners and 4 edges. When a window is dragged to one of these zones, 
    it is automatically resized and repositioned. 
    The zones work as follows:

    * 4 corners - dragging a window into a corner will resize it to 1/4 
      of the screen size and position it in that corner.
    * Left, right, and bottom edges - dragging a window to one of these 
      edges will resize it to 1/2 of the screen size and snap it 
      to the corresponding edge.
    * Top edge - dragging a window to the top edge of the screen will 
      maximize it to fill the entire screen.

         Here we are again and a third issue...  Time flies by and
         we "the Amiga herd" are getting older and old but Amiga 
         fire is there as it was in early/mid 90s. War was on and 
         it was not pretty, death to IBM compatible PCs was the
         slogan of that age. This only shows money rules them all.
  @{JCENTER}@{IMG "GUIDEDIR:files/inteloutside.gif"}@{JLEFT}
         If Commodore had better management and money they would
         still face great competition from PCs growing market on
         it's own inevitably transition.
         
         The 68k, in 1994 best 68k was 68060 50MHz 67 MIPS at same
         time Motorola announced it was last in line while PCs
         got at same year a Pentium 100 at 100MHz 166 MIPS now
         both has their pros and cons but I believe P100 was the
         general stronger/faster one...
         
         I think we can take a peek at Mac, same year 1994 Apple
         moves to PPC from 68k, Mac has a simple approach, no 
         complex chipset, in my opinium this is boring just like 
         a PC machine. PPC601 outperforms Pentium in early 1994
         
         Amiga started same journey a bit later in 1995, AmigaOS 4
         was released 2006 same year Apple leaves PPC for Intel
         because PPC is falling behind in performance...
         I remember this was discussed among Amigans... 
         
         Amiga stayed on PPC course and in 2020 Apple moved to 
         ARM this time it's because of bad engineering by Intel,
         chips are too hot, consumes more and more power...
         
         IF Amiga was still one of the biggest it probably would
         not run on a PPC CPU...
         
         Amiga PPC cost way too much for general users! I feel 
         like more effort should be put in to bring cost down
         and gain more users, use a existing platform. 
         PPC HW has no advantages over existing platforms.
         
         
         How fast is X5000 compared with Pi5 ?? I tried to find
         out... 
         
         
         I have for many years wanted to try out AmigaOS 4. 
         For such generic HW I think max Euro 500 not Euro 2400
         Alinea computer. Now many years has passed so my interest 
         is gone but I still read about it, follow news and hold 
         my fingers crossed that something beautiful will happen!
         
         
         If Amiga was to use anything other than 68k it should 
         choose a cheap modern CPU and keep chipset in a FPGA
         
         
         We have our trusty 68k with really big growing pain, 
         expansion is crazy, all kinds of HW pops up and even 
         AmigaOS 68k gets new releases and updates and insane
         amount of new games ;) and the price is right mostly.
         
         
         
         Amigas future ???
         
         We consumers are it's future... build expensive
         Amiga gear is not going to help anyone, dead end!

         This is PocketStorm, it's FPGA chipset + Pi4/5 with
         Emu68 JIT. Developer Claude Schwarz  
        
         FPGA used is a Tang Nano 20K
      
         
         This is seriously powerfull, should be pretty cheap too
         
         This Amiga could gain big sales if it's ever released!
         
         
         Now there is actually development going on that is
         similair to PocketStorm and that's..

         AmiCube F1200
         It got chipset in FPGA and CPU socket, this socket
         is a 16-bit one as found on A500, don't know if this 
         going to be a performance limit.
         Memory is mentioned to be 6+64MB, AGA core  
                          
         There is also a new AmiCUBE Mini in development

       I've been working in the shadows on this game for a long time
       and it's not done.. About 6 month in to the developent and 
       I've hit 2MB chip ram limit, so some work is to lower the chip 
       ram usage. 
       
       It's AGA game 2MB chip and some FAST. HDD
       
       Game is complex to code, I've just recently noticed this chip 
       ram flaw and I feel like cutting in it would be like cutting 
       your legs ha ha ha ok not that bad but I'll fix it.

       Story
       
       At 56 you took a chance on this undercover detective job! 
       Maybe you are too old for this...  Theres something going on 
       in northern parts of Sweden and you are here to uncover it all.
       
       As a undercover you need to maintain your normal delivery job
       and help out those living in outposts scattered around while 
       you investigate the death of a curior.
       
       You think, easy.... nope there is alot to keep track on like
       ammo, food, cold, dangerous animals...
       
       and to win the game, all outpost has to give you 5 star rating
       and you have to advance to max level(5) and XP(99) and solve
       the story and do all this before you get too old and die ;)

I still have found memories and this was one of the favourites
and I think it still a very nice done demo, Ambrosia also made 
the great 3D game Genetic Species AGA RTG CD

  32se onliner does not save anything 
  When a new issue is online, old is gone!
  To save/preserv this you find it in RAM:32se-main/
  
  If you get enviroment error during online check then run Prefs/Locale 
  set and save 
  
  HiP, Play16 and Lha needs to be in path eg. in c:
  (if you try this without 32se)
