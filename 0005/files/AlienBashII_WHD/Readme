ABII can be run from H/D - just copy all the files to
one directory and run it from there.
A500 owners with 1MB will probably only be able to run
the game from disk.
A500 owners with more than 512k chip ram will get all
the sound enhancements the 1200 owners get.

If there are any bugs in the game, please inform me
(leave me a message on Junction 9) and I'll try to
fix them and release an updated version into P.D.
(if you find any whoppers, please don't tell me!).

One thing....MIAC!!! (Those who know.....know)

Glen.
